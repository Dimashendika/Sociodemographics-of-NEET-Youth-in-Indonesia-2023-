**Key Insights**

- Sociodemographic factors significantly shape NEET outcomes among Indonesian youth. This study highlights key risks tied to health, gender, education, marital status, rural location, and family size.
- Health issues are the strongest predictor of NEET status. Youth with poor health are nearly 7 times more likely to become NEET compared to those in good health.
- Marital status matters: married youth are 3.5 times more likely to be NEET than those who are single, widowed, or divorced.
- Female youth are 1.4 times more likely to be NEET than males, highlighting gender-based disparities in education and employment access.
- Youth who have never attended any training are 1.6 times more likely to be NEET, underscoring the importance of skill-building programs.
-Those living in rural areas are significantly more vulnerable to NEET status, suggesting geographical inequality in access to opportunities.
- Larger household size (more than 5 members) slightly increases the likelihood of becoming NEET.

Interestingly, youth with higher education levels are more likely to become NEET than those with only junior high school education, possibly due to labor market mismatch or longer transition periods.

**Recommendations**

Bridge Rural Gaps
- Expand access to education, vocational training, and modern agricultural jobs in rural areas to reduce geographic inequality.

Support Female Participation
- Provide gender-responsive policies such as vocational programs for women, childcare subsidies, and flexible work to encourage education and employment access.

Assist Married Youth
- Offer support for young married individuals—especially women—through programs like affordable childcare and re-skilling pathways.

Align Education with Jobs
- Improve school-to-work transitions by adopting dual education or apprenticeship models that link formal education to labor market needs.

Scale Up Skills Training
- Enhance programs like the Pre-Employment Card, with a focus on remote areas and long-term employability.

Address Youth Health Barriers
- Introduce health-oriented support (e.g., job placement or mental health services) for youth with physical or psychological health challenges.

Target Vulnerable Families
- Provide conditional cash transfers and access to education for youth from large or low-income households to break the cycle of disadvantage.
